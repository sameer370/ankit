        <font size=5>Ever since the wave of economic liberalization in1991, the Indian IT Industry has grown many folds
            both in terms of its size and also in terms of its status. In many ways, the IT Industry has put India
            prominently on the global map. From a handful of organisations in early 1990â€™s, the industry can now boast
            than 1500 organisations, Indian and MNCs and as many as two million people directly or indirectly employed.
            With its huge base of English speaking and professionally qualified manpower, India has become a destination
            of choice for most global organisations. Today, nearly, all of the fortune 500 organisations source their
            software development requirements from India.
