        <font size=5>Media (the plural of medium) are the collective communication outlets or tools that are used to
            store and deliver information or data.It is either associated with communication media, or the specialized
            communication businesses such as: print media and the press, photography, advertising, cinema, broadcasting
            (radio and television), and/or publishing.
            Modern communication media now allow for intense long-distance exchanges between larger numbers of people
            (many-to-many communication via e-mail, Internet forums, and teleportation). On the other hand, many
            traditional broadcast media and mass media favor one-to-many communication (television, cinema, radio,
            newspaper, magazines, and also facebook).
