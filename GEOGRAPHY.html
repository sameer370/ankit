            The "Geography of India" describes the geographic features of India, a country in South Asia. India lies
            largely on the Indian Plate,
            the northern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, whose continental crust forms the Indian subcontinent.
            The country is situated
            north of the equator between 8°4' and 37°6' north latitude and 68°7' and 97°25' east longitude.It is the
            seventh-largest country in the
            world, with a total area of 3,166,414 square kilometres (1,222,559 sq mi).India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi)
            from north to south and
            2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to west. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km (9,445 mi) and a coastline of
            7,517 km (4,671 mi).</p>
        <p>
            On the south, India projects into and is bounded by the Indian Ocean – in particular, by the Arabian Sea on
            the southwest, the
            Laccadive Sea to the south, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast.</p>
        <p>The northern frontiers of India are defined largely by the
            Himalayan mountain range, where the country borders China, Bhutan, and Nepal.Its western border with
            Pakistan lies in the Punjab
            Plain and the Thar Desert.On the east, its border with Bangladesh is largely defined by the Khasi Hills and
            Mizo Hills, and the
            watershed region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.</p>
        <p>The Ganges is the longest river originating in India. The Ganges–Brahmaputra
            system occupies most of northern, central, and eastern India, while the Deccan Plateau occupies most of
            southern
            India.Kangchenjunga, on the border between Nepal and the Indian state of Sikkim, is the highest point in
            India at 8,598 m (28,209 ft)
            and the world's 3rd highest peak. Climate across India ranges from equatorial in the far south, to alpine
            and tundra in the upper
            reaches of the Himalayas.</p>
