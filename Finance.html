        <font size=5>Finance is a field that deals with the allocation of assets and liabilities over time under
            conditions of certainty and
            uncertainty. Finance also applies and uses the theories of economics at some level. Finance can also be
            defined as the science of
            money management. A key point in finance is the time value of money, which states that purchasing power of
            one unit of currency
            can vary over time. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of
            return. Finance can be broken
            into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.
