            There are several languages in India belonging to different language families.The Constitution of India does
            not give any language
            the status of National Language.The official languages of the Union Government of the Republic of India are
            Hindi in the Devanagari
            script and English.The Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, which have been
            referred to as scheduled
            languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement.</p>
        <p>According to Census of India of 2001, India has 122
            major languages and 1599 other languages.The 2001 Census recorded 30 languages which were spoken by more
            than a million
            native speakers and 122 which were spoken by more than 10,000 people.Two contact languages have played an
            important role in the
            history of India: Persian and English.Hindi, the most widely spoken language in India today, serves as a
            lingua franca for much of the
            country.
