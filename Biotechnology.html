        <font size=5>Indian Biotech Industry is on the threshold of rapid growth. The industry took shape in 1999 and
            has seen the
            emergence of over 100 promising start-ups, launched by leading scientists from top rated research centres.
            Almost all the major
            pharma companies have started Biotech divisions. The industry employs 6000 biotechnologists and 28 top
            universities in the country
            provide the highly qualified manpower that is needed. The industry is growing up superb growth rates and is
            expected to turn India
            into a major Biotechnology hub by the end of 2020.
