            India, it is often said, is not a country, but a continent. Stretching from the frozen summits of the
            Himalayas to the tropical greenery of Kerala, its expansive borders encompass an incomparable range of
            landscapes, cultures and people. Walk the streets of any Indian city and you’ll rub shoulders with
            representatives of several of the world’s great faiths, a multitude of castes and outcastes, fair-skinned,
            turbanned Punjabis and dark-skinned Tamils. You’ll also encounter temple rituals that have been performed
            since the time of the Egyptian Pharaohs, onion-domed mosques erected centuries before the Taj Mahal was ever
            dreamt of, and quirky echoes of the British Raj on virtually every corner.
        <p>The most-travelled circuit in the country,so-called Golden Triangle in the north: Delhi itself, the colonial
            capital; Agra, home of the Taj Mahal; and the Pink City of Jaipur in Rajasthan.</p>
        <p>With travel in Kashmir still largely limited to its capital, Srinagar, and central valley area, Himachal
            Pradesh – where Dharamsala is the home of a Tibetan community that includes the Dalai Lama himself – and the
            remote province of Ladakh.</p>
        <p>Heading south from Kolkata (Calcutta) along the coast, your first likely stop is Konarak in Odisha, site of
            the famous Sun Temple.Tamil Nadu, further south, has also retained its own tradition of magnificent
            architecture,further up the coast is Goa, the former Portuguese colony whose 100km coastline is fringed with
            beaches to suit all tastes and budgets,Mumbai, an ungainly beast that has been the major focus of the
            nationwide drift to the big cities. Centre of the country’s formidable popular movie industry.</p>
        <p> The Himalayan resort of Manali, Shimla, immortalized in the writing of Rudyard Kipling.Elsewhere, the
            combination of sand and the sea, and a picturesque rural or religious backdrop – such as at Varkala in
            Kerala, Gokarna in Karnataka, and the remoter beaches of Goa.
