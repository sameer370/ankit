            India is credibly the only country with the largest and most diverse mixture of races. A spell-binding
            country where people of unlike
            communities and religions live together in oneness. India is a very culturally diverse country. People speak
            hundreds of different
            languages (18 major languages, with English and Hindi as the official languages). But the beauty lies in the
            fact that despite all the
            differences, people live with full harmony and love depicting their varied cultures, traditions and dressing
            styles.</p>
        <p>According
            to our rich past, a country like India has been invaded by armies, traders and migrants who brought with
            them their own habits,
            faiths, practices and honourings which have all added to the rich feel of Indian life and living.</p>
        <p>The food, clothing and habits of
            an Indian differ in accordance to the place of origin. With the advancement in pace, and culture, Indian
            women have altered
            themselves to be more modernistic and hep.The traditional Indian dress is the Sari which can be worn in many
            ways. Indian dresses
            consist of several beautiful designs, which are also worn by women of other national groups. The Salwar
            Kameej is the second most
            popular dress and is attaining popularity fast with the younger generation. Women also wear lehanga cholis
            etc.</p>

            men in villages are still more comfortable in traditional attire like kurtas, lungis, dhotis and pyjamas.
            Indian fashion includes a wide
            range of designs for women, men, and children. The men in cities wear shirts and pants and live in a
            modernized manner.However
