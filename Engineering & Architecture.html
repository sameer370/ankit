        <font size=5>Architectural engineering, also known as building engineering, is the application of engineering
            principles and technology to building design and construction. Definitions of an architectural engineer may
            refer to:
            An engineer in the structural, mechanical, electrical, construction or other engineering fields of building
            design and construction.Structural engineering involves the analysis and design of physical objects
            (buildings, bridges, equipment supports, towers and walls).Structural engineers require expertise in
            strength of materials and in the seismic design of structures covered by earthquake engineering.

    <p>Mechanical engineering and electrical engineering engineers are specialists, commonly referred to as (mechanical,
        electrical, and plumbing) when engaged in the building design fields.Mechanical engineers often design and
        oversee the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, and rain gutter systems. Plumbing
        designers often include design specifications for simple active fire protection systems, but for more
        complicated projects, fire protection engineers are often separately retained. Electrical engineers are
        responsible for the building's power distribution, telecommunication, fire alarm, signalization, lightning
        protection and control systems, as well as lighting systems.
