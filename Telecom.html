        <font size=5>Telecommunication is communication at a distance by technological means, particularly through
            electrical signals or
            electromagnetic waves.The word is often used in its plural form, telecommunications, because it involves
            many different
            technologies.A communications network is a collection of transmitters, receivers, and communications
            channels that send
            messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together
            to transmit
            information to the correct user.
