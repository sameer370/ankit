            Culture plays an important role in the development of any nation. It represents a set of shared attitudes,
            values, goals and practices.
            Culture and creativity manifest themselves in almost all economic, social and other activities. A country as
            diverse as India is
            symbolized by the plurality of its culture.</p>
        <p>India has one of the world’s largest collections of songs, music, dance, theatre, folk
            traditions, performing arts, rites and rituals, paintings and writings that are known, as the ‘Intangible
            Cultural Heritage’ (ICH) of
            humanity. In order to preserve these elements, the Ministry of Culture implements a number of schemes and
            programmes aimed at
            providing financial support to individuals, groups and cultural organizations engaged in performing, visual
            and literary arts
            etc.</p>
        <p>India the colourful and vibrant land is as diverse as its people. The mosaic of art and culture, the
            potpourri of tradition,
            India stands as one of the oldest living civilization which has offered to the rest of the world the
            elemental sound ‘Aum,’ the concept
            of zero and the richness of yoga. A treasure of art and culture, India is just not a land but the storehouse
            of beauty, dream, tradition
            and verve.
